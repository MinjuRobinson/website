                    <p>Here, enjoy swimming in Sandy Beach, where the water is very clear and warm. It is too safe for children to swim because the water is not deep. It is a beach swimming that the whole family can enjoy. It's a great place to relax on a very fine and soft sandy beach. There is a cafe 5 minutes walk distance.
